# Database Directory

This directory contains database-related files for the Algiers University Attendance System.

## Contents

Currently empty - previously contained SQLite database files. Now using MySQL server.

## Usage

This directory can be used for:
- Database migration scripts
- Backup files
- Schema documentation
- Import/export files

## Note

The application now uses MySQL instead of SQLite, so no local database files are stored here.
All database operations are performed on the MySQL server configured in `includes/config.php`.
